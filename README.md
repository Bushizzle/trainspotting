This is a simple trainspotting application. As it is a challenge, I decided to use as many fancy things as I could but still tried to stay reasonable.

You can edit input data (stations, lines, trains) in /public/data.json, also you can change some default settings in /src/config folder

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `yarn start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode

### `yarn lint`
Launches pretty tough linter, you can't commit or push without passing it

### `yarn build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />o
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
